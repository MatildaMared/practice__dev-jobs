# Todo App

This is a solution to
the [Devjobs web app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/devjobs-web-app-HuvC_LP4l)
. I have been provided with a Figma sketch, assets such as icons and images, and a README file
explaining the challenge. All the code and functionality is written from scratch by me 😊

## The challenge 📝

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time
  position
- Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for
  the job
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _
  Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.
